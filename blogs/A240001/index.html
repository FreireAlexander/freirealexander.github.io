                Creating your own website is quite an experience, but I assure you, seeing your project published on the internet is a truly rewarding achievement. Earlier this year, I set myself the challenge of developing my own website. From the beginning, I established a few rules: I had to build it using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Vanilla. Yes, JavaScript Vanilla — because I wanted to test my web development skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Initially, the idea was simple: to create an online version of my Curriculum vitae. However, what started as a modest project quickly transformed into something much more ambitious. Now, six months later, this challenge has evolved to include new requirements that pushed me to explore a wide range of topics, such as interface design, databases, web servers, virtual machines, and much more. In this article, I'd like to share some of those insights with you.

                The First Version: My Curriculum vitae Online
            </h2>
            <p>
                The first version of my website was, quite literally, my Curriculum vitae, formatted exactly as it would appear in print, but accessible online. However, I soon faced a dilemma: how could I publish my site under my own domain? 
            </p>
            <p>
                At first, I hosted my Curriculum vitae on a GitHub Page, but I wasn't satisfied with the <strong>“.github.io”</strong> at the end of the URL. I wanted something more personal—something that reflected my identity and helped me start building my brand. Purchasing a domain was relatively straightforward, as there are many options available online, such as Hostinger or Namecheap. However, this decision raised new questions: What is an SSL certificate? What is virtual hosting? These questions made my project even more challenging.

                Exploring Free Solutions
            </h2>
            <p>
                During my research, I wondered if there were free options for SSL certificates or affordable virtual hosting services. To my surprise, I found solutions for both, although SSL certificates posed challenges that deserve a dedicated article. Some useful tools I discovered were:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Certbot
                </li>
                <li>
                    acme.sh
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For hosting, Oracle Free Tier proved to be an excellent choice. However, configuring these services and understanding how they work required overcoming several technical obstacles.

                Overcoming New Challenges
            </h2>
            <p>
                As time passed, the project grew, and new challenges arose. One of the most significant was improving the visual design of the site. While I have some knowledge of Sass, I'm not a graphic designer, but I knew my projects needed to look good. This led me to delve deeper into design and seek inspiration. Here are some topics I believe are essential for anyone starting in web development:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Personal Branding: </strong> If you already have your server and domain, why not build your personal brand? This involves reflecting on what you want to share with the world and how you want to be perceived. A website is more than an online Curriculum vitae; it's a window to showcase who you are and what you can offer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>UX Design: </strong> Interface design is crucial. People from diverse backgrounds will interact with your site, and making navigation intuitive should be a top priority.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Design Systems: </strong>Having a design system will help you organize colors, fonts, images, and styles consistently. You can even create your own guide using tools like Notion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Organization and Time Management: </strong>
                    Whether you're working in a team or solo, managing your time is essential. Tools like Notion, Google Calendar, or even Slack can help you plan tasks and track your progress. These metrics will allow you to adjust strategies and deadlines as needed.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Beyond a Simple Project</h2>
            <p>
                Applying these concepts took my website to new levels. I added more style, structure, and functionality, and even implemented databases to automate content generation. Challenges like designing custom cards to display articles and projects, automating repetitive sections like the header and footer, or defining a solid visual identity not only enriched my project but also strengthened my programming skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each step is an achievement. Watching your website grow and reflect your efforts is incredibly satisfying. My biggest advice: do it for the passion, have fun, and enjoy the process of creating your own space on the internet.
            </p>

                This is my first article and marks the beginning of many more. I hope you enjoyed this brief story about how I created my website. In future articles, I'll share more specific details about the development of some of its features.
